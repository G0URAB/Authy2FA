### Authy Two Factor Authentication(2FA) USING Plain PHP and JavaScript
In this project there is a login system and also a 2FA feature using Authy API. The implementation uses curl in PHP to talk to Authy server. If the user activates 2FA, then in the next login attempt, the user will get an OTP(One time password) as an SMS and the user will use this SMS to authenticate and to login to the system.
